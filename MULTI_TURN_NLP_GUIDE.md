# Multi-Turn Slot-Filling Dialogue NLP System Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide describes the implementation of a multi-turn slot-filling dialogue NLP system for workout and meal tracking. The system uses state-of-the-art transformer models for intent classification and token classification to provide a conversational interface for logging workouts and meals.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Intent Classification Model** - Determines user intent (workout logging, meal logging, etc.)
2. **Token Classification Model** - Extracts entities (exercises, foods, numbers, etc.)
3. **Dialogue State Manager** - Tracks conversation state and slot filling progress
4. **Slot Validator** - Validates and normalizes extracted slot values
5. **Response Generator** - Generates appropriate system responses

### Model Recommendations

#### Intent Classification Model
**Primary Recommendation: `facebook/bart-large-mnli`**
- **Why**: Excellent zero-shot classification capabilities
- **Alternative**: `google/gemma-2b-it` (as requested, but may be overkill)
- **Fallback**: `distilbert-base-uncased` (faster, smaller)

#### Token Classification Model  
**Primary Recommendation: `FacebookAI/roberta-large`** (as requested)
- **Why**: State-of-the-art performance for NER tasks
- **Alternative**: `dslim/bert-base-NER` (general purpose)
- **Fallback**: `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` (dialogue-specific)

## üîÑ Dialogue Flow

### Workout Logging Flow

```
User: "I want to log a workout"
System: "Great! What type of workout did you do? (e.g., chest and tricep day, leg day)"

User: "It was chest and tricep day"
System: "Perfect! What exercises did you perform? (e.g., Barbell Bench Press, Cable Tricep Extensions)"

User: "I did barbell bench press and cable tricep extensions"
System: "Great! I've recorded your chest and tricep day workout. Would you like to save this for future use or just log it for today?"

User: "Save it for future use"
System: "Perfect! I've saved your workout for future use."
```

### Meal Logging Flow

```
User: "I want to log a meal"
System: "Great! What food did you eat? (e.g., chicken and rice, protein shake)"

User: "I ate chicken and rice"
System: "Good! How many calories was that? (e.g., 500 calories, 800 cal)"

User: "It was 500 calories"
System: "Perfect! I've recorded your meal. Would you like to save this for future use or just log it for today?"

User: "Just log it for today"
System: "Got it! I've logged your meal for today."
```

## üéØ Intent Classification

### Intent Types

1. **`workout_logging`** - User wants to log a workout
2. **`meal_logging`** - User wants to log a meal  
3. **`load_saved`** - User wants to load a saved workout/meal
4. **`edit_saved`** - User wants to edit a saved workout/meal
5. **`save_for_future`** - User wants to save current data for future use
6. **`log_for_today`** - User wants to log current data for today only
7. **`other`** - General conversation or unclear intent

### Training Data Examples

```python
# Workout Logging Examples
"I just finished a chest workout" ‚Üí workout_logging
"I did some exercises today" ‚Üí workout_logging
"I lifted weights this morning" ‚Üí workout_logging
"I went to the gym and did bench press" ‚Üí workout_logging

# Meal Logging Examples  
"I ate chicken and rice for lunch" ‚Üí meal_logging
"I had a protein shake" ‚Üí meal_logging
"I consumed 500 calories for breakfast" ‚Üí meal_logging

# Load Saved Examples
"Load my saved chest workout" ‚Üí load_saved
"Show me my saved meals" ‚Üí load_saved

# Edit Saved Examples
"I want to edit my saved workout" ‚Üí edit_saved
"Change my saved meal" ‚Üí edit_saved
```

## üè∑Ô∏è Token Classification (NER)

### Entity Types

1. **`EXERCISE`** - Exercise names (bench press, squat, deadlift)
2. **`FOOD`** - Food names (chicken, rice, protein shake)
3. **`NUMBER`** - Numeric values (reps, sets, calories, protein grams)
4. **`WEIGHT`** - Weight units (lbs, kg, pounds)
5. **`WORKOUT_TYPE`** - Workout categories (chest day, leg day, upper body)
6. **`MEAL_TYPE`** - Meal categories (breakfast, lunch, dinner)

### Training Data Examples

```python
# Workout Examples
"I did chest and tricep day with barbell bench press"
# Tokens: ["I", "did", "chest", "and", "tricep", "day", "with", "barbell", "bench", "press"]
# Labels: ["O", "O", "B-WORKOUT_TYPE", "I-WORKOUT_TYPE", "I-WORKOUT_TYPE", "I-WORKOUT_TYPE", "O", "B-EXERCISE", "I-EXERCISE", "I-EXERCISE"]

"I did 3 sets of 10 reps bench press with 135 lbs"
# Tokens: ["I", "did", "3", "sets", "of", "10", "reps", "bench", "press", "with", "135", "lbs"]
# Labels: ["O", "O", "B-NUMBER", "O", "O", "B-NUMBER", "O", "B-EXERCISE", "I-EXERCISE", "O", "B-WEIGHT", "I-WEIGHT"]

# Meal Examples
"I ate chicken and rice with 500 calories"
# Tokens: ["I", "ate", "chicken", "and", "rice", "with", "500", "calories"]
# Labels: ["O", "O", "B-FOOD", "I-FOOD", "I-FOOD", "O", "B-NUMBER", "O"]
```

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Model Setup

```python
# Install required packages
pip install transformers torch numpy scikit-learn

# Initialize models
from transformers import pipeline

# Intent Classification
intent_classifier = pipeline(
    "text-classification",
    model="facebook/bart-large-mnli",
    device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
)

# Token Classification  
token_classifier = pipeline(
    "token-classification", 
    model="FacebookAI/roberta-large",
    device="cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
)
```

### Step 2: Training Data Generation

You need to create thousands of training examples:

**Intent Classification: 5,000-10,000 examples**
- Various ways to express each intent
- Different user speaking styles
- Edge cases and ambiguous inputs

**Token Classification: 10,000-20,000 examples**
- Different exercise and food names
- Various number formats and units
- Mixed entity types in single sentences

**Multi-turn Dialogues: 1,000-2,000 complete dialogues**
- Different dialogue flows
- Error corrections and clarifications
- Various slot filling orders

### Step 3: Model Training

```python
# Intent Classification Training
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./models/intent_classifier",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    load_best_model_at_end=True,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

trainer.train()
```

### Step 4: Integration

```python
# Initialize the multi-turn processor
nlp_processor = MultiTurnNLPProcessor(use_gpu=True)

# Process a dialogue turn
result = nlp_processor.process_dialogue_turn(
    user_id="user123",
    text="I want to log a chest workout"
)

print(result['response'])
# Output: "Great! I can help you log a workout. What type of workout did you do?"
```
